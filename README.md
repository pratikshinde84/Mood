The Digital Mood Tracker is an interactive web application that allows users to track their moods over time. Users can log their moods by selecting from four different mood options (Happy, Sad, Neutral, and Angry), and the app will record the selected mood along with the current date. The app provides two key features:

Mood History: Displays a list of all the moods the user has logged, including the date and type of mood.
Mood Chart: A dynamic pie chart that visually represents the distribution of the user's logged moods.
The application stores mood data using the browser's localStorage, ensuring that the data persists even after the browser is closed or refreshed.
